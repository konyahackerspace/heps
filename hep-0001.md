## What is a HEP?
HEP stands for **Hackerspace Enhancement Proposal**.

A HEP is an open proposal document to make our hackerspace a better place in a particular direction. When created systematically[^1], HEPs will help us openly and clearly discuss matters and document our processes regarding Konya Hackerspace.

## When to create a HEP?
When you want to propose a major change directly affecting many people in the hackerspace, you are encouraged to create a HEP and get feedback from the community members.

Good examples of creating a HEP include situations like:
- You want to create an electronics lab in one corner of the space
- You want to pledge for buy an expensive toaster to the hackerspace
- You want to set up some rules for how and when to use 3D printers
- You want to describe how to operate when adding a new smart sensor to the network
- You want to install a security system in the place and collect pledges for it
- You want to create some software to manage membership fees and want others to be included

## How to create a HEP?
To create a HEP, you need two things:
1. A markdown document named `hep-XXXX.md`[^2] in the root of this repository.
2. A pull request to the `main` branch that adds `hep-XXXX.md`

When this pull request is reviewed by the community, concerns of other members regarding your change are resolved, 
and enough pledgers are found (if you are collecting pledges for a project) the PR will be merged into `main`. That will make your change effective.

## How to modify a HEP?
Before merging the original pull request, you are free to make as many changes as you want. That's trivial.

After a HEP is created and its PR is merged, 
if you (or someone else) want to make some changes, you can create another PR modifying the original file and adding a link to the new PR to the file metadata.

If there is a new HEP making an old one obsolete, or based on a recent discussion you want to make a HEP obsolete, you can open a PR, modify the HEP file to update its status from `Active` to `Obsolete`.

## How does pledging work with HEPs?
If you are describing a project where you want to collect money from members, you can describe how much money is needed showing a breakdown of costs and a bill of materials. You can create a pledging table in the file, add your own pledge and wait for people to pledge in PR comments. When a person pledges money, you can add their name to the table.

A HEP with a pledge should not be merged until the total required amount is pledged by members.

## Who can contribute to HEPs?
Everyone in the community is encouraged to contribute to our decision-making, whether by submitting new proposals or commenting on them.
