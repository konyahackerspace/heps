## What is a HEP?
HEP stands for **Hackerspace Enhancement Proposal**.

A HEP is an open proposal document to make our hackerspace a better place in a particular direction. When created systematically[^1] HEPs will help us openly and clearly discuss matters and document our process regarding Konya Hackerspace.

## When to create a HEP?
When you want to propose a major change directly affecting many people of the hackerspace, you are encouraged to create a HEP and get feedback from the community members.

Good examples for creating a HEP, include situations like:
- You want to create an electronics lab in one corner of the space
- You want to pledge to buy an expensive toaster to the hackerspace
- You want to set up some rules for how and when to use 3D printers
- You want to describe how to operate when adding a new smart sensor to the network
- You want to install a security system to the place and collect pledges for it
- You want to create some software to manage membership fees and want others to be included

## How to create a HEP?
To create a HEP you need two things:
1. A markdown document named as `hep-XXXX.md`[^2] in the root of this repository.
2. A pull request to the `main` branch that adds `hep-XXXX.md`

When this pull request is reviewed by the community, other members' concerns regarding your change are resolved, 
and enough pledgers are found (if you are collecting pledges for a project) the PR will be merged to `main`. That will make your change effective.

## How to modify a HEP?
Before merging the original pull request, you are free to do as many changes as you want, that's trivial.

After a HEP is created and its PR is merged, 
if you (or somebody else) want to make some changes, they can create another PR modifying the original file and adding the link to the new PR to the file metadata.

If there is a new HEP making an old one obsolete, or based on a recent discussion you want to make a HEP obsolete, you can open a PR, modify the HEP file to update its status from `Active` to `Obsolete`.

## How pledging works with HEPs?
If you are describing a project where you want to collect money from members, you can describe how much money is needed showing a breakdown of costs and bill-of-materials. You can create a pledging table in the file, add your own pledge and wait people to pledge in PR comments. When a person pledges money, you can his name to the table.

A HEP with a pledge should not be merged until the total of the necessary money is pledged by members.

## Who can contribute to HEPs?
Everyone in the community are encouraged to contribute to our decision making, whether by submitting new proposals or commenting on them.
