## Introduction
This HEP defines the community, members, keyholders and management of the hackerspace
and describes the processes around getting into one of these groups. It also proposes
a brief space access scheme which can be detailed in further HEPs.

![venn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb6c54ad-453d-4f39-880b-6ba1bc318ff5)

The people who has any interest in the hackerspace can be defined as four nested groups:


Title | Definition 
--- | --- 
Community | Anyone in the community communication medium.
Members | Paying members of `Konya Teknoloji Derneği`.
Keyholders | Trusted, volunteering members who can provide physical access to the space.
Management | Management board of `Konya Teknoloji Derneği`.

## Community
Community consists of everyone who is interested in Konya Hackerspace and is accepted 
into the community communication medium [^1].

### Joining the Community
Joining the community is free but with approval. Anyone can follow a public link to an 
application form. After a person fills the form and accepts the community code of conduct,
the form is examined by a subset of members, which we will call: **community managers**.
Community managers can approve the applications to join the community or reject them if 
they think the applicant doesn't have a culture fit.

### Community Moderation
The discussions in the community can happen under multiple channels overseen by the community
managers. Community managers act as moderators and ensure the discussions stay in the boundaries
defined in community code of conduct. Community managers report violations to the hackerspace
management.

### Why Maintain a Community
The people within the community might choose not to become a member and pay regularly. They might
live out of town or don't see enough value using the physical space regularly. Yet, they might
still want to get notified of our public events, join discussions around their topics of interests
or wait until they know members more to make a decision about being a member.

People in the community may be funneled into being members, may donate occasionally, may attend
events as guest speakers, might contribute to the open-source projects of the hackerspace or 
may benefit members by their knowledge, network or ideas.

### Community Benefits
A person accepted to the community can:
- Can visit the space in the community hours
- Can attend public events (they need to get a ticket if this is a ticketed event)
- Can ask for a demo tour in the space if there's a member willing to host the tour

## Members
Members of the hackerspace are the same with the members of `Konya Teknoloji Derneği`. They pay
membership fee regularly and are the backbone of the hackerspace.

### Becoming a Member
When somebody in the community wants to be a member, they need to:
- find one referring member and
- fill a digital membership application form.

The application is announced to all existing members and they are requested to comment if they have
any concerns with the person joining as a member. The application is held at least for a few days to
let members have enough time to comment [^2].

Members of the management board, after reviewing the application and possible concerns of other members,
can approve or reject the membership application.

If management approves a membership application, the new member should:
- pay the fee of the first month in advance
- read and ink-sign some legal documents such as by-laws, membership forms, liability waivers, etc.

and after that they gain their membership rights.

Members should be at least 18 years old and legally eligible to become a member.

### Membership Rights
A member:
- can access the hackerspace when the space is open and a keyholder is present.[^3]
- can have project storage in the hackerspace.
- can use tools and resources[^4] within the hackerspace.
- can lead and organize one-time or recurring events.
- can create HEPs.
- has priviliged access to public events when tickets are limited.
- can apply to become a keyholder.

### Membership Fees
At the time of writing this HEP membership fee is:
- 2000₺ per month for regular members.
- 500₺ for the students and unemployed.

Applicants will be asked for proofs if they want the discounted rate and they are entitled to inform
the management when their status changes.

Membership fees and discounted rates can be further defined in time by the management.

### End of Membership
Members can end their membership when they want but their debts won't clear out. Members can be kicked out
by the management at any time if they violate the rules.

Temporary membership is discouraged. If people are becoming a member only to use tools
and equipment heavily for short periods of time and end their membership after, they risk
being rejected next time they apply.

## Keyholders
Keyholders are volunteering[^5] members who can open or close the hackerspace and hence provides access to other members. Keyholders
are responsible and trustworthy people who are known by many people in the space.

Members who are not keyholders can only access the hackerspace during the presence of a keyholding member.

Even though keyholders are not entitled to be present whenever a member wants to get in, they are expected to be regularly available and present
in the space.

### Becoming a Keyholder
Members can apply to become a keyholder if they fulfill these criteria:
-  they have been members for at least 3 months (or they became members in 2025)
-  they have been paying membership fees regularly
-  they have referral from another keyholder
-  they are willing to be present in the space regularly

When a member applies to become a keyholder, this is announced to all of the members so that they can comment on the 
application if they have any concerns with this member holding the key.

After reviewing the application and possible concerns of other members, management approves or rejects the application.

Members of the management are keyholders by definition.

### Revoking Keyholder Status
When a keyholding member wants to let go of this status, starts not being regularly present at the space or loses trust
of the members, management can revoke their keyholder status.

## Management
Management of the hackerspace currently aligns with the management of `Konya Teknoloji Derneği`.

Members of the management are keyholders by definition and they also hold access to critical keys and info, is held legally
accountable, and has final say on critical decisions.

The members of the management may include some, if not all, members in the governing process by asking their opinions,
and by addressing their concerns.

Legally, all of the members has a right to be elected to the board of managers when asked in a general member meeting. How
management is elected, and how it operates are defined in the by-laws of the association and in the relevant laws.

## Visiting Policy
- Keyholders can visit the space whenever they want.
- Keyholders open the space when they enter, if they are the first keyholder to enter.
- Keyholders close the space when they exit, if they are the last keyholder to exit.
- Members can visit the space, when the space is open (meaning there is at least one keyholder in the space all the time
during the visit).
- Non-members can visit the space if:
  * they are in the community and
  * they at least one of the below are true:
    + visit happens during a community hour / open house time
    + this is a public event and they have a ticket
    + this is a demo tour hosted by a member. (demo tours can be given if a person is highly interested in becoming a member)
    + they normally live out of town but visiting Konya (this should be arranged by the management)
- Young kids may visit with their legal guardian members but should generally be discouraged to visit the space.[^6]
- As a rule of thumb, if a minor would visit the hackerspace, management should approve the visit beforehand.
- When someone outside the community wants to visit the space (a member's parent, a repairman, a government official, etc.), the access
can be granted by a keyholder or a manager temporarily judging the importance or risk of the visit.

## Funnel and Screening
The membership structure described in this document has several well-defined steps for screening strangers into wonderful associates.

` ` | Screening | Duration
--- | --- | ---
Community | People are screened for culture-fit by community managers. Obvious red flags are gated out. | Takes a day or two.
Members | They are evaluated further in person by the members and managers. | Takes a week or two.
Keyholders | They are screened further for consistent responsibility and trust by the members and managers. | Takes more than 3 months.
Management | They are evaluated by the members for their consistent vision and success in operating the hackerspace. | Could take years.

[^1]: At the time of writing, the medium is Whatsapp but this can change in the future and is irrelevant
to this HEP.
[^2]: [Hacklab Toronto](https://hacklab.to) rejects an application automatically if two or more members give a negative comment.
This keeps problematic people out of the hackerspace and prevent possible harm in advance.
[^3]: The technicalities of are omited from this HEP because they are out of the scope. Members can be given RFID cards.
Keyholders can issue a digital lock. Management can have an additional physical lock, etc.
[^4]: Terms and conditions apply. Fair use and training might be demanded.
[^5]: If one day, we become a crazy big organization, we can have staff keyholders who are paid.
[^6]: The hackerspace is one of the most dangerous places for unattended kids to be in. The exception would be if we ever
organize events targeting kids, and when so, safety precautions should be taken.
