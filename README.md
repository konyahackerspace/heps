# Hackerspace Enhancement Proposals

HEPs are a living documentation of initiatives, pledging and decision-making in Konya Hackerspace.

If you are planning to make a major change in our physical space or in how we operate as a community, you are encouraged to create a HEP to clearly describe your proposal.
