## Summary
This HEP describes how we can manage the internal network on a fundamental level 
to prevent unauthorized access to our network and internet connected devices in 
the space.

## Rationale
Hackers of all kinds of backgrounds would be common guests of our space. The idea 
of "hacking a hackerspace" might sound exciting for some of them. Also, motivated 
with curiosity some of our members might try to tinker, configure and eventually 
break things on our network, rendering other hackers frustrated. These precautions 
would help us contain possible attempts of dangerous curiosity.

## Securing Physical Access to the Router
One of the easiest and most frustrating attack vector is to gain physical access 
to the router, follow factory reset sequence on the hardware and hence disconnect 
all connected devices from the network. This would let the attacker to reconfigure 
the network as he'd like and create many further attack vectors.

We must keep the router in a difficult to reach place, possibly locked in a hard 
plastic enclosure to discourage tampering.

Another layer to prevent and remedy physical access would be to issue surveilliance 
to close proximity of the router, so if anybody attempts to tinker, the community admins
would get notified of the attempt, possibly with picture evidence.

## Storing Router Admin Credentials Securely
We should ensure the credentials to admin dashboard of the router to be stored securely.
The less people to know it the better. We shall use the password manager of hackerspace's 
Google account aside with other critical passwords.

## Creating Multiple Wireless Networks
We shall create different wireless networks serving different purposes:

\# | Type | Hidden | Criticality | Purpose
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Infrastructure | Hidden | Most Critical | Security systems, smart sensors, automation devices lives in this network.
2 | Member Network | Visible | Critical | Computers and smartphones of the members, printers, 3D printers, shared or interactive electronics live here.
3 | Guest Network | Visible | Less critical | Only guests are connected, no smart devices should connect here.

We shall not provide LAN access to the router since it's not easy to control who is connected to what and nowadays wireless is fast enough.
